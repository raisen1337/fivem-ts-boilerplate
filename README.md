# FiveM Typescript Boilerplate ðŸ“¦

The name speaks for itself. It's a FiveM Typescript boilerplate to help you get started with making scripts in typescript!

# Why Typescript?
Because Typescript is currently the most used programming language now, and it's future proof with a bunch of libraries that can help you and ease your development process.

# Getting started

Clone the project using git or Github Desktop

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/raisen1337/fivem-ts-boilerplate
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd fivem-ts-boilerplate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm i
```

Start development:

```bash
  npm run watch
```

Every time you create a new folder/file in ```src/client``` or ```src/server``` you must restart the ```npm run watch``` command.
